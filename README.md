# Income Prediction using Classification Algorithms and Hyperparameter Tuning

This project focuses on predicting income levels using various classification algorithms and hyperparameter tuning techniques. The dataset used in this analysis is the "Adult Income" dataset, which is commonly used for income prediction tasks.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to develop and compare multiple machine learning models to predict whether an individual's income exceeds $50,000 per year based on various demographic and employment-related features. The project involves the following steps:
1. Data Preprocessing
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3. Model Building
4. Hyperparameter Tuning
5. Model Evaluation

## Notebooks

The project is organized into several Jupyter Notebooks, each focusing on different aspects of the analysis:

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, feature scaling.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizing the distribution of features, analyzing correlations, and identifying patterns.
3. **Model Building**: Implementing various classification algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machines.
4. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Using techniques like Grid Search and Random Search to optimize model performance.
5. **Model Evaluation**: Comparing models using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.

## Dependencies

The project requires the following Python libraries:
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn

You can install the necessary libraries using the following command:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

## Usage

To run the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/income-prediction.git](https://github.com/Garry864/Income_Classification_Project.git)
    cd income-prediction
    ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Open the Jupyter Notebooks in your preferred environment (e.g., Jupyter Lab, Jupyter Notebook, or Google Colab) and run the cells sequentially.

## Results

The results of the analysis include:
- Data visualizations showing the distribution of features and relationships between them.
- Performance metrics for each model.
- Insights gained from hyperparameter tuning.
- The best-performing model based on evaluation metrics.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the application of various classification algorithms and hyperparameter tuning techniques to a real-world income prediction task. By comparing multiple models and optimizing their parameters, we can achieve higher predictive accuracy and better understand the factors influencing income levels.
